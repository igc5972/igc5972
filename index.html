                        <p>&#128075; Hi! I'm Isa (they/he)</p>
                        <p>&#128188; I am currently a PhD candidate at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) working with Dr. Jeyhan Kartaltepe.</p>
			<p>&#128270; I am interested in galaxy evolution, SED modeling, and galaxy morphology.</p>
                        <p>&#128190; I code primarily in Python, but I am comfortable debugging anything!</p>
                        <p>&#128752; I use data from JWST!</p>
			<p>&#128101; I am also interested in disability, accessibility, and inclusion in astrophysics.</p>

                                <b>Motivating Research Interests</b><br>
                                Studying assembly of stellar mass for intermediate redshift galaxies (0.5 < z  < 4; "Cosmic Noon"). Analyzing resolved property maps of galaxies constructed through pixel-by-pixel SED fitting by making non-parametric measurements. Investigating the role of internal star-formation vs. external star formation (e.g., from mergers) and the impact of each on galaxy growth.<br><br>

                                <i>galaxy evolution; galaxy mergers and interactions; moderate-redshift; high-redshift; high performance computing; SED modeling; computer vision</i><br><br>


								<b>JWST Surveys</b><br>
                                Using JWST data from CEERS, PRIMER, NGDEEP, and COSMOS-Web on the NIRCam instrument.<br><br>

                                <b>CEERS Photometric Catalogue</b><br>
                                I am leading the efforts for the official NIRCam + HST photometric catalogue for the CEERS collaberation. Publication in prep!
